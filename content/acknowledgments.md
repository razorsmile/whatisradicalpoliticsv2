## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This course builds on years of radical political education work and countless conversations with comrades. Special thanks to all who have facilitated, participated in, and contributed to developing these materials.

In particular the work I have done with the FREE UNIVERSITY BRIGHTON (FUB) and all the students who have attended my courses over the last decade and all my colleagues and comrades who helped organise and teach at FUB.

The course draws on traditions of popular education, workers' inquiry, and participatory action research. It stands on the shoulders of generations of organisers and educators committed to democratic, accessible political education.

Reed has four principles for what he calls 'social education' that are useful starting points for thinking about radical education:

1. Use learners' values and social interests to determine the purpose, direction and character of the learning process 
2. Make the social practice of the learners the basic content of the study process
3. Link the learner's practice to the historical development of society
4. Draw on lessons and experiences of other progressive groups to improve learners' practice.
