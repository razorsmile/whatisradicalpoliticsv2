<h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Opening & Recap (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Welcome back. Last week we explored six radical traditions. Tonight we're examining how different traditions relate to state power - arguably THE central strategic question for radical politics.

Who brought research to share? We'll hear those in hour two.

First, let's briefly check in: what stayed with you from last week?"

[2-3 brief shares]

<h5>Part 1: Three Orientations to the State (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Tonight's framework comes from a phrase used by various movements: 'In, Against, and Beyond the State.' These aren't mutually exclusive strategies - many movements combine them."

[Draw triangle on flipchart with three points labeled, or show the diagram:]

    </div>

**IN THE STATE**

Working through electoral politics, policy, and state institutions to achieve radical goals.

- **Logic:** The state has unique power to redistribute resources and reshape society
- **Methods:** Elections, legislation, public ownership, welfare systems
- **Local examples:** Your Party councilors, Greens implementing community wealth building
- **Risks:** Co-optation, bureaucratization, limits of parliamentary democracy

**AGAINST THE STATE**

Confronting state power through resistance, disruption, and refusal.

- **Logic:** The state is fundamentally an instrument of domination that cannot be reformed
- **Methods:** Direct action, strikes, blockades, squatting, civil disobedience
- **Local examples:** Anti-raids networks, squatting movements, poll tax resistance
- **Risks:** Repression, marginalization, inability to build alternatives

**BEYOND THE STATE**

Building parallel institutions and counter-power outside state control.

- **Logic:** We must create new forms of social organization rather than seizing existing ones
- **Methods:** Cooperatives, mutual aid networks, community land trusts, alternative currencies
- **Local examples:** Local food cooperatives, community gardens, time banks
- **Risks:** Isolation, lack of resources, limited scale

These orientations reflect different theories of power and change."

<h5>Part 2: The Housing Crisis as Case Study (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Let's apply this framework to the housing crisis to see how each orientation offers different approaches.

First, let's research the problem - what is your local housing context?

- Average house price? How many times the local average salary is it?
- Average rent? What portion of the average wage does it make up?
- How many people on the local council house list? What's the average waiting time?
- How many rough sleepers in your town or city?

[Allow participants to share any data they know, or note you'll research these together]

Now let's look at how each orientation might address this:

**IN THE STATE - A Political Party's Housing Platform:**

- Rent controls and tenant protections
- Mass council housing construction
- Community right to buy
- Wealth taxes to fund social housing

This assumes we can win electoral power and use the state to decommodify housing.

**AGAINST THE STATE - Direct Action Approaches:**

- Rent strikes and eviction resistance
- Squatting empty properties
- Blocking estate agent offices
- Disrupting property developer meetings

This takes over empty buildings directly to house rough sleepers despite legal threats.

**BEYOND THE STATE - Alternative Models:**

- Community Land Trusts
- Housing cooperatives
- Mutual aid networks for housing support
- Self-build projects

These create non-commodified housing outside market and state systems.

Most effective movements combine strategies. The 1915 Glasgow Rent Strikes used 'against' tactics (strikes) to win 'in' victories (rent controls) while building 'beyond' structures (tenants' organizations)."

</div>

<h5>Part 3: Strategic Debates (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"These orientations raise crucial debates:

**The Parliamentary Road?**

Can we vote our way to socialism? Your Party says yes with the right movement behind it. Critics point to Chile's Allende, Greece's Syriza - radical governments crushed or co-opted.

**Diversity of Tactics?**

Should movements combine all three orientations or does that dilute focus? Some argue for 'dual power' - building counter-institutions while also engaging electoral politics.

**Prefiguration vs Power?**

Do we focus on modeling the future society now (beyond) or seizing levers of change (in)? Do means determine ends?

**Local vs National?**

Our local council has limited powers. Can municipal socialism work within national constraints? Or must change happen at every scale simultaneously?"

</div>

<h4>HOUR 2: Open Discussion (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Jargon Buster (5 mins)</h5>

[Remind participants about their jargon buster handout. Ask if anyone has questions about terms from last week or new terms they've encountered. Quickly review this week's key concepts.]

**Key Terms for Session 2:**

- **The state:** Government institutions plus military, police, courts, bureaucracy
- **Civil society:** Organizations and relationships outside state and market
- **Dual power:** Alternative institutions competing with state authority
- **Prefigurative politics:** Organizing in ways that embody desired future
- **Recuperation:** System's ability to absorb and neutralize radical challenges
- **Autonomy:** Self-governance independent of state control

<h5>Participant Research Sharing (15 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Who researched something to share? Remember, 2 minutes each."

[Keep time strictly, thank each person, note themes on flipchart]

</div>

<h5>Small Group Exercise: Strategy Mapping (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Form groups of 3-4. Choose a specific issue in our area:

- Homelessness
- Low wages
- Climate crisis
- NHS privatization
- Police violence

Design a campaign using ALL THREE orientations. What would you do in, against, and beyond the state? How would these strategies support each other?"

[15 mins small group work]

[5 mins report back - each group shares one insight]

</div>

<h5>Open Discussion (20 mins)</h5>

**Discussion Prompts:**

1. "Where do you see Your Party on this triangle? Is it purely 'in' or does it engage other orientations?"
2. "What examples from your own experience combine these strategies?"
3. "Is working 'in' the state always reformist or can it be revolutionary?"
4. "How do we avoid the traps of each orientation?"

<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script for Closing:**

"Next week we'll dig into our area's radical history - learning how previous generations navigated these strategic questions. If you want to contribute, research a specific event, movement, or figure from our local radical past. We'll build our collective knowledge together."
