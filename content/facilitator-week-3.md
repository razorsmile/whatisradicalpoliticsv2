<h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Opening (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Tonight we become historians of our area's radical past. History isn't neutral - what gets remembered, how it's told, who tells it - these are political questions. We'll explore three historical moments from Brighton as examples, then build our collective knowledge about our own locality.

But first - who researched our local radical history to share?"

[Note names for hour two]

<h5>Part 1: The Hidden Transcript (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Before we dive into history, let's introduce a key concept: the **hidden transcript**.

This comes from James C. Scott's work on resistance. He distinguished between two kinds of political discourse:

**The Public Transcript:** What we say and do in front of power - carefully managed, deferential, often compliant.

**The Hidden Transcript:** What we say and do 'offstage' - our real critiques, anger, resistance expressed in private, in disguised forms, or behind power's back.

Every subordinated group creates hidden transcripts. They're where dissent, subversion, and resistance live when it's too dangerous to express openly.

**Example:** Aggy, an enslaved woman, maintained quiet obedience publicly. But in private, she confided a 'finely drawn and highly visual image of an apocalypse, a day of revenge and triumph' - a complete reversal of her public deference.

Why does this matter for radical history? Because most resistance is hidden. Official archives record public transcripts - obedience, compliance. To find resistance, we must look for hidden transcripts: private conversations, coded language, disguised practices, moments when the mask slips.

As you research our local history, ask: What hidden transcripts existed? Where did people speak freely? What forms did disguised resistance take?"

<h5>Part 2: Why Radical History Matters (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Why study radical history locally?

- **Inspiration:** Seeing ordinary people achieve extraordinary things
- **Learning:** Understanding what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Connection:** Realizing we're part of a longer struggle
- **Resources:** Discovering tactics, strategies, and models we can adapt

Radical historiography means:

- Centering marginalized voices
- Looking for patterns of resistance
- Questioning official narratives
- Finding hidden transcripts of struggle

Every locality has a hidden history of resistance beneath its official image."

<h5>Part 3: Three Historical Moments (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

**These examples are from Brighton, but similar struggles occurred in most areas. You will need to research your own locality's history using these same frameworks.  This section is offered as an example.**

**1. THE 1934 UNEMPLOYED WORKERS' MOVEMENT (7 mins)**

**Brighton Example:** During the early 1930s, Brighton hosted an active branch of the National Unemployed Workers’ Movement. Like the rest of the organisation, it paired direct confrontation with local authorities—marches, deputations, office occupations and resistance to evictions—with forms of mutual aid and community support. These actions linked immediate needs to wider structural critiques of unemployment and poverty.

Local leadership, exact participant numbers and specific incidents require verification from Brighton’s newspaper and archival record. What can be stated with confidence is that NUWM activity in the city reflected the broader national pattern: organised pressure on relief authorities, public demonstrations against the Means Test, and practical solidarity among unemployed and low-waged workers. The combination of resistance and mutual support allowed the movement to challenge punitive welfare policies and, in several places, secure improvements in relief and prevent individual evictions. This dynamic—struggle against the existing system paired with collective practices that prefigure something beyond it—remains a central historical lesson of the NUWM.

**2. THE 1970s SQUATTING MOVEMENT (7 mins)**

**Brighton Example:** By 1975, the city had over 500 squatters while 3,000 properties stood empty. The movement wasn't just about housing - it was prefigurative politics in action.

Key occupied spaces:

- The Richmond: Squatted hotel becoming housing co-op
- Wykeham Terrace: Row of mansions turned into commune
- Multiple empty office blocks converted to homes

They created:

- Squatters' handbook and legal support network
- Children's nurseries and food cooperatives
- Radical community newspaper (The Brighton Voice)
- Networks linking housed and unhoused solidarity

The 1977 Criminal Law Act criminalized squatting in residential buildings - direct state response to the movement's success.

Legacy: Several current housing co-ops originated as squats. The model of taking direct action for housing needs continues today."

**3. AGAINST THE POLL TAX (1989-1991) (6 mins)**

"The Poll Tax - a flat-rate local tax regardless of income - triggered the largest civil disobedience campaign in modern British history.

**Brighton Example:** The city was crucial to its defeat. Local resistance included:

- 30,000 non-payers by 1991 (20% of those liable)
- Anti-Poll Tax Union met weekly at the Unemployed Centre
- Mass rallies at the Level
- Resistance to bailiffs through community phone trees
- Legal support and court solidarity

March 1990: 3,000 marched locally. When London exploded in the Poll Tax Riots, local activists were there.

Success factors:

- Unity across class lines
- Combination of non-payment (against) and mutual support (beyond)
- Clear demand: abolition not reform
- Practical solidarity: accompanying people to court

The tax was abolished in 1991. Thatcher resigned. Proof that collective refusal works."

<h5>Part 4: Patterns and Methods (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"What patterns do we see across these struggles?

**Successful tactics:**

- Direct action combined with mutual aid
- Clear demands linked to systemic critique
- Practical solidarity not just symbolic support
- Creating alternative institutions while fighting existing ones

**How to research radical history:**

- Oral history: Interview participants while they're alive
- Alternative archives: Union records, radical newspapers, personal collections
- Read against the grain: What do hostile sources reveal?
- Place-based investigation: What happened on your street?
- Question absences: Whose stories are missing?

Your research matters. Official history won't preserve these stories - we must."

</div>

<h4>HOUR 2: Open Discussion (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Jargon Buster (5 mins)</h5>

[Remind participants about their jargon buster handout. Ask if anyone has questions about terms from previous weeks or new terms they've encountered. Quickly review this week's key concepts.]

**Key Terms for Session 3:**

- **Historiography:** The study of how history is written
- **Hidden transcript:** Resistance practices invisible to power
- **Collective memory:** Shared understanding of the past
- **Counter-narrative:** Alternative to dominant historical accounts
- **Oral history:** Historical method using interviews and testimony
- **Praxis:** Unity of theory and practice

<h5>Participant Research Sharing (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Let's hear what you've discovered about our area's radical past. As you listen, think about patterns and connections."

[Strict 2-minute time keeping, map connections on timeline]

</div>

<h5>Collective Mapping Exercise (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Let's build our collective knowledge. On this map of our area, let's mark:

- Sites of historical struggles
- Current radical spaces
- Where you live/work/organize
- Connections between past and present

Come up and add your knowledge. This is our radical historiography."

[Participants add to collective map]

"What patterns do you see? Where does resistance cluster? What spaces recur?"

</div>

<h5>Discussion: Past to Present (15 mins)</h5>

**Discussion Prompts:**

1. "Which historical tactics could work today? Which couldn't and why?"
2. "What's different about organizing in 2024 versus 1934 or 1974?"
3. "How do we ensure today's struggles become tomorrow's inspiring history?"
4. "What stories of resistance from your own family or community should be preserved?"

<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script for Closing:**

"Next week, our final session, we'll map working-class counter-power in our area today. We'll use methods from Italian Marxist sociology - workers' inquiry and co-research - to identify where collective power exists now.

Optional task: Identify one mutual aid project, self-organized space, or community infrastructure in our locality. We'll build a resource map together."
