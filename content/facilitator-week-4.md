<h5>Opening: What is Workers' Inquiry? (15 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">
    <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
    <p>"Welcome to our final session. Tonight we'll use a methodology called 'workers' inquiry' or 'co-research' - the practice of systematically investigating working-class life not as academics studying subjects, but as workers investigating our own conditions.</p>
    <p>This method emerged from Italian Marxism in the 1960s. Romano Alquati worked with FIAT factory workers not to extract data but to collectively analyze their struggles. The research was the struggle.</p>
    <p>Three key principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>From the inside:</strong> Workers are experts on their own conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Partisan knowledge:</strong> Research serves organizing, not neutrality</li>
        <li><strong>Co-research:</strong> Breaking down researcher/researched divide</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tonight we'll map the counter-power that already exists in Brighton - the spaces, networks, and practices where working-class people exercise collective capacity outside capitalist and state control."</p>
</div>

<h5>Part 1: Four Categories of Counter-Power (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">
    <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
    <p>"We'll organize our inquiry around four overlapping categories. These aren't rigid boxes - most projects span multiple categories."</p>
</div>

<div class="traditions-grid four-plus-one">
    <div class="tradition-card">
        <h4>Mutual Aid Networks</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Reciprocal support systems meeting immediate needs outside market and state.</p>
        <p><strong>Brighton Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food banks and community fridges</li>
            <li>Time banking networks</li>
            <li>Skill-shares and tool libraries</li>
            <li>Refugee and migrant support groups</li>
            <li>Childcare cooperatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Power:</strong> Demonstrates we can meet needs collectively</p>
        <p><strong>Limits:</strong> Can become service provision without challenging root causes</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tradition-card">
        <h4>Self-Organized Spaces</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Physical and social spaces controlled by communities, not capital or state.</p>
        <p><strong>Brighton Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social centers (Cowley Club, Common Cause)</li>
            <li>Community gardens and allotments</li>
            <li>Housing cooperatives</li>
            <li>Independent music venues</li>
            <li>Hackspaces and maker spaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Power:</strong> Creates autonomous infrastructure for organizing</p>
        <p><strong>Limits:</strong> Vulnerable to gentrification and commodification</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tradition-card">
        <h4>Alternative Economies</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Economic practices refusing wage labor, commodity exchange, or exploitation.</p>
        <p><strong>Brighton Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Worker cooperatives</li>
            <li>Community-supported agriculture</li>
            <li>Local currencies and time banks</li>
            <li>Really Really Free Markets</li>
            <li>Squatted social spaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Power:</strong> Prefigures non-capitalist economic relations</p>
        <p><strong>Limits:</strong> Scale limitations, market pressures</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tradition-card">
        <h4>Knowledge Commons</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Collective production and sharing of knowledge outside academic and corporate control.</p>
        <p><strong>Brighton Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Autonomous education projects</li>
            <li>Free universities and radical reading groups</li>
            <li>Community archives and oral history projects</li>
            <li>Open-source tech collectives</li>
            <li>Movement media and publishing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Power:</strong> Democratizes knowledge production</p>
        <p><strong>Limits:</strong> Can remain isolated from broader struggles</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tradition-card multitude-card">
        <h4>The Multitude</h4>
        <p>Philosopher Antonio Negri uses "the multitude" to describe not a unified working class but a plural, diverse formation of all who labor under capital. Counter-power exists wherever the multitude self-organizes: in workplaces, homes, streets, and digital spaces. These four categories are how the multitude builds capacity for collective self-determination.</p>

<h5>Part 2: Mapping Exercise Introduction (15 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">
    <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
    <p>"Now we'll build our collective map. Think about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What projects, spaces, or networks do you participate in?</li>
        <li>What mutual aid exists in your neighborhood?</li>
        <li>Which workplaces have union activity?</li>
        <li>What examples of collective power do you encounter?</li>
        <li>Which of the six traditions (from Week 1) do these embody?</li>
        <li>How do they connect to each other?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll use colored pins:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Mutual aid networks</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Self-organized spaces</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Alternative economies</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Knowledge commons</li>

<div class="facilitator-script">
    <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>What it is</li>
        <li>Which category (or categories)</li>
        <li>One sentence on its significance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>[Participants add pins to map - facilitator notes connections]</p>
    <p>"Look at the density. Where does counter-power cluster? What connections exist? What's missing?"</p>
    <p>[5 mins facilitator-led observation of patterns]</p>
</div>

<h5>Small Group Analysis (10 mins)</h5>

<div class="facilitator-script">
    <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
    <p>"Let's close with a round. One word or phrase: what are you taking from these four weeks?"</p>
    <p>[Quick round - everyone contributes one word/phrase]</p>
    <p>"Thank you all for your knowledge, your curiosity, and your commitment. This map represents real counter-power. As the IWW says: 'We are building the new world in the shell of the old.' That building happens in spaces and projects like these - and through connections between them.</p>
    <p>I'll photograph this map and share it digitally. Use it. Add to it. Organize from it. This is our collective resource.</p>
    <p>And remember: you are now part of Brighton's radical history. What happens next is up to us."</p>
