<h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Opening: What is Workers' Inquiry? (15 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Welcome to our final session. Tonight we'll use a methodology called 'workers' inquiry' or 'co-research' - the practice of systematically investigating working-class life not as academics studying subjects, but as workers investigating our own conditions.

This method emerged from Italian Marxism in the 1960s. Romano Alquati worked with FIAT factory workers not to extract data but to collectively analyze their struggles. The research was the struggle.

Three key principles:

- **From the inside:** Workers are experts on their own conditions
- **Partisan knowledge:** Research serves organising, not neutrality
- **Co-research:** Breaking down researcher/researched divide

Tonight we'll map the counter-power that already exists in our area - the spaces, networks, and practices where working-class people exercise collective capacity outside capitalist and state control."

<h5>Part 1: Four Categories of Counter-Power (20 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"We'll organise our inquiry around four overlapping categories. These aren't rigid boxes - most projects span multiple categories."

</div>

<div class="traditions-grid four-plus-one">

<div class="tradition-card">

### Mutual Aid Networks

Reciprocal support systems meeting immediate needs outside market and state.

**Local Examples:**

- Food banks and community fridges
- Time banking networks
- Skill-shares and tool libraries
- Refugee and migrant support groups
- Childcare cooperatives

**Power:** Demonstrates we can meet needs collectively

**Limits:** Can become service provision without challenging root causes

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### Self-Organised Spaces

Physical and social spaces controlled by communities, not capital or state.

**Local Examples:**

- Social centers and community spaces
- Community gardens and allotments
- Housing cooperatives
- Independent music venues
- Hackspaces and maker spaces

**Power:** Creates autonomous infrastructure for organising

**Limits:** Vulnerable to gentrification and commodification

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### Alternative Economies

Economic practices refusing wage labor, commodity exchange, or exploitation.

**Local Examples:**

- Worker cooperatives
- Community-supported agriculture
- Local currencies and time banks
- Really Really Free Markets
- Squatted social spaces

**Power:** Prefigures non-capitalist economic relations

**Limits:** Scale limitations, market pressures

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### Knowledge Commons

Collective production and sharing of knowledge outside academic and corporate control.

**Local Examples:**

- Autonomous education projects
- Free universities and radical reading groups
- Community archives and oral history projects
- Open-source tech collectives
- Movement media and publishing

**Power:** Democratizes knowledge production

**Limits:** Can remain isolated from broader struggles

</div>

<div class="tradition-card multitude-card">

### We Are The Multitude - a new way to understand our class
 
Philosopher Antonio Negri uses "the multitude" to describe not a unified working class but a plural, diverse formation of all who labor under capital. Counter-power exists wherever the multitude self-organises: in workplaces, homes, streets, and digital spaces. These four categories are examples of how the multitude builds capacity for collective self-determination.

<h5>Part 2: Mapping Exercise Introduction (15 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Now we'll build our collective map. Think about:

- What projects, spaces, or networks do you participate in?
- What mutual aid exists in your neighborhood?
- Which workplaces have union activity?
- What examples of collective power do you encounter?
- Which of the six traditions (from Week 1) do these embody?
- How do they connect to each other?

We'll use colored pins:

- **Red:** Mutual aid networks
- **Blue:** Self-organised spaces
- **Green:** Alternative economies
- **Yellow:** Knowledge commons

Jot down notes on your worksheet first, then we'll map together."

[10 mins individual/pair work with worksheets]

<h5>Transition to Hour 2</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Hold onto your notes. After the jargon buster and participant shares, we'll build the map together."

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h4>HOUR 2: Open Discussion (60 mins)</h4>

<h5>Jargon Buster (5 mins)</h5>

[Remind participants about their jargon buster handout. Ask if anyone has questions about terms from previous weeks or new terms they've encountered. Quickly review this week's key concepts.]

**Key Terms for Session 4:**

- **Workers' inquiry (conricerca):** Research methodology where workers investigate their own conditions
- **Counter-power:** Collective capacity to refuse domination and create alternatives
- **The multitude:** Diverse formation of all who labor under capitalism
- **Commons:** Resources governed collectively, neither private nor state property
- **Circulation of struggles:** How movements in different places/sectors influence each other
- **Composition:** The technical, social, and political organisation of the working class

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h5>Participant Research Sharing (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Who researched examples of counter-power to share? Brief 2-minute presentations."

[Keep time, thank contributors]

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h5>Collective Mapping Exercise (25 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Let's build the map. Come up and add your pins. As you do, briefly say:

- What it is
- Which category (or categories)
- One sentence on its significance

[Participants add pins to map - facilitator notes connections]

"Look at the density. Where does counter-power cluster? What connections exist? What's missing?"

[5 mins facilitator-led observation of patterns]

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h5>Small Group Analysis (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"In groups of 3-4, discuss:

- What surprised you about the map?
- What gaps or absences do you notice?
- How could existing projects strengthen each other?
- What new initiatives might fill gaps?

[Groups discuss - facilitator circulates]

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h5>Final Discussion (10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Final reflections:

- What did this four-week course illuminate for you?
- How will you use this knowledge?
- What connections will you pursue?
- How do we keep this conversation going?

[Open discussion - aim for 6-8 contributions]

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

<h5>Closing Circle (5-10 mins)</h5>
<div class="facilitator-script">

**Facilitator Script:**

"Let's close with a round. One word or phrase: what are you taking from these four weeks?"

[Quick round - everyone contributes one word/phrase]

"Thank you all for your knowledge, your curiosity, and your commitment. This map represents real counter-power. As the IWW says: 'We are building the new world in the shell of the old.' That building happens in spaces and projects like these - and through connections between them.

I'll photograph this map and share it digitally. Use it. Add to it. Organise from it. This is our collective resource.

And remember: you are now part of our area's radical history. What happens next is up to us."
