## Course Philosophy

The course is designed around participatory, experience-based learning:

- **Everyone is an educator**: Draw on participants' knowledge and lived experience
- **Locally grounded**: Connect concepts to your community's specific context
- **Practically oriented**: Create tangible outcomes and resources
- **Collectively built**: Learning happens through dialogue and co-research

### Using the Concept of Hidden Transcripts

Introducing the concept of **hidden transcripts** early in the course can be a powerful pedagogical tool. This concept, from James C. Scott's work, describes the political discourse that happens "offstage" - the critiques of power that subordinate groups express away from those who dominate them.  A brief introduction to the concept is contained in Session 3 (History) but you may want to use that introduction earlier than the history session, perhaps in an informal and light way to begin with, returning to it when you talk about radical history.

**Why introduce this early:**

The hidden transcript concept helps participants connect academic theory to their lived experiences. Everyone has moments where they've expressed different views in private than in public - at work with colleagues versus management, with family versus strangers, or in trusted groups versus public settings. This universal experience provides an accessible entry point for discussing power relations.

**How to use it:**

- Ask participants to reflect on times they've had a "public transcript" (what they could safely say) versus a "hidden transcript" (what they actually thought)
- Use this to explore how power shapes what can be openly discussed
- Connect personal experiences to collective patterns of resistance
- Apply it when researching local history - looking for hidden transcripts in historical sources
- This can be a way to help understand the concept of 'hegemony' (as a public transcript) and the lived reality of resistance in the hidden transcript.  Exploring why it's a 'hidden' transcript and not a 'private' one can be one way of facilitating this conversation.

**Benefits:**

- **Validates personal experience**: Participants see their own experiences of navigating power as politically meaningful
- **Builds critical analysis**: Develops skills in reading power dynamics in everyday situations
- **Connects micro to macro**: Links personal encounters with power to broader structural analysis
- **Democratizes knowledge**: Academic concepts become tools for understanding lived reality, not abstract theory

This approach reinforces the course philosophy that everyone is an educator - participants' experiences become learning resources for the whole group.

## Getting Started

There are scripts prepared for each session.  These should enable you to have enough content to work with, but they are intended as **stimulus** for political conversation, not as something that has to be learnt and tested. Be flexible in each session and be attentive to what the participants want to do.


### Before the Course

- Review all session materials thoroughly
- Prepare any physical materials or handouts
- Set up the space to encourage discussion
- Consider accessibility needs of participants
- Adapt examples to your local context - **this is particularly the case with Session 3 and 4**, which involve participants in doing their own research work grounded in their local context.  For these sessions the facilitator must ensure they have some examples of both history and local organisation - if you don't know then talk to your comrades.  Someone locally will have this knowledge!

### During Sessions

- You can use the Session pages as a form of presentation display.  You should be able to scroll to the appropriate section on a full screen display.
- Start with introductions and ground rules (contained in Handout 1)
- Use the **jargon buster** to demystify academic terms - ask about other terms that might be added to open up the conversation - return to it at the beginning of the second hour after the break each time.
- Encourage questions and challenges 
- Make space for different perspectives 
- Document insights and questions that emerge

## Facilitation Tips

### Creating Safe Space

- Establish confidentiality agreements (see Handout 1)
- Acknowledge power dynamics in the room (in particular acknowledge any academic privilege if you have it)
- Make space for different communication styles (and be cautious of imposing academic language if that's your background)
- Be prepared to navigate disagreement constructively

### Keeping Discussion Focused

- Use the discussion questions as anchors
- Bring conversations back to concrete examples
- Connect abstract concepts to lived experience
- Set a time-limit for activities to maintain momentum - 'Let's spend 10 minutes...''
- But remember, the content is a **stimulus** to conversation, so if the conversation is productive then don't close it down to simply try and get through the content.

### Handling Challenging Moments

- Political education can surface tension - that's productive
- Make space for discomfort while maintaining respect
- Use the idea of "productive tensions" explored in session 1 as a framework to explore disagreements
- Consider as you listen whether to pause and reflect or push forward

## Session Structure

Each 2-hour session typically follows this pattern:

1. **Welcome & Check-in** (15 min)
2. **Core Content** (45 min)
3. **Break** (10 min)
4. **Discussion & Activities** (40 min)
5. **Wrap-up & Optional Task** (10 min)

Adjust timing based on your group's needs and energy.
