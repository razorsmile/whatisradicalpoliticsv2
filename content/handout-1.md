## Welcome!

This four-week course explores radical politics through four academic lenses, providing you with analytical tools for understanding and engaging with radical political movements.

## What to Expect

- **No mandatory homework** - all tasks are optional
- **Experience valued** - your knowledge matters as much as any text
- **Disagreement welcome** - tensions between ideas are productive
- **Local focus** - everything relates to our area and our lives here

## Schedule

**Week 1 (Philosophy):** What Makes Politics Radical?

**Week 2 (Political Theory):** In, Against, and Beyond the State

**Week 3 (History):** Our Radical History - Past and Present

**Week 4 (Sociology):** Mapping Working-Class Counter-Power

## Optional Engagement

Each week offers optional tasks for going deeper. These might include:

- Researching local history
- Identifying radical projects
- Reading suggested texts
- Contributing to collective mapping

## Ground Rules

- What's shared here stays here (unless someone explicitly agrees otherwise)
- Step up/step back - make space for all voices
- Critique ideas, not people
- Start from curiosity, not judgment
