### Remember:

Political education isn't separate from political action - they develop together. Every struggle is a classroom, every action teaches us something new.

### Key Principle:

*"Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom; to develop critical consciousness or to domesticate."* - Paulo Freire

**The choice is ours.**
