## A Brief History of Workers' Inquiries

By Matt Lee

Why a 'social inquiry'?

The term 'social inquiry' is vague and, at first glance, has little to distinguish itself from sociological, ethnographic or cultural historical forms of academic research. Whilst it has some connections to numerous academic fields it arises as a tactic from a particular political practice called the 'workers inquiry' and a contemporary theoretical concept of the 'social strike'. This brief historical survey traces the use of the tactic and focuses on the way in which it conceives the relation between 'inquirer' and 'inquired upon' and the development and shifts in this relationship, in particular as it involves a broader question of the relation between theory and practice and the various figures this relation is instantiated in.

## First Moment: Marx's Questionnaire (1880)

The 'workers inquiry' can trace its roots to Marx and his questionnaire. This set of questions was drawn up by Marx in conjunction with the french journal La Revue Socialiste in 1880 as part of an attempt to expose the conditions of the working class in France. The declared aim of the inquiry was to pressure the french republic to instigate legal reforms akin to those that had recently been implemented in England.

There is no indication that Marx ever received any response to the questions La Revue Socialiste posed and it is unclear whether the tactic had any practical effect in achieving its stated aims. Despite this less than stellar result the epistemological assumption that the working class was the source of knowledge regarding its conditions, rather than external experts carrying out studies, influenced the revolutionary movement.

## Second Moment: Johnson-Forest Tendency (1940s-50s)

In America, in the 1940's and 50's, a small group called the 'Johnson-Forest' tendency (JFT) takes up the tactic of the workers inquiry and transforms it. Johnson (C.L.R. James) and Forest (Raya Dunayevskaya) had formed a small tendency in the Trotskyist Workers Party in 1941 and split from that Party in 1947 over issues of race.

In opposition to the 'multi-racialism' of the Trotskyist Workers Party the Johnson-Forest tendency argued that the black communities of America had their own specific conditions and needs that couldn't be simply merged into generic struggles. The specific reality of black communities needed to be addressed and a degree of autonomy granted to those struggles. Again, a notion of epistemological priority was granted to the communities in struggle, along with a clear sense of differentiation dependent on the particular conditions of struggle.

This was reflected in the journal the JFT published, called **Correspondences**. This journal attempted to transform personal accounts from various sectors of the working class (the journal was divided into four sections, one each for factory workers, women, youth and the black community) into social awareness through a process of generating correspondences and connections between particular situations. Haider and Mohandesi argue that it was an attempt to 'generalise the gripe' from being a personal problem to being a social fact as part of a strategy of 'consciousness raising'.

It is worth noting that at this point the tactic of a 'workers inquiry', as the JFT implemented it, shifted from the questionnaire to the narrative form. The various stories of the working class, different but connected in their form, were transformed into a semi-literary structure through a process of 'co-authorship' that brought to the fore problems of authorship, intention and co-option.

## Third Moment: Socialisme ou Barbarie (1949)

In 1947 the JFT had published a pamphlet called 'The American Worker'. The pamphlet was a combination of a "self-reflexive ethnographic investigation" and an attempt to "theorize the content of socialism in a world changed by automation, the assembly line, and semi-skilled labor" and was the first real moment in the development of the JFT's tactic of workers inquiry they subsequently developed in their journal Correspondences.

This pamphlet was translated into French by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie (SOB) in the first edition of their own journal in 1949. SOB was at the time struggling with two large problems – the role of the Soviet Union and the position of the working class within that society and the role of the intellectual with regard working class practice (a particular instance of a wider problematic of the relation between 'theory' and 'practice' that has been central to the revolutionary movement since Lenin).

The group had again formed as a tendency inside a Trotskyist group, led by Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lefort, both of whom were academic intellectuals. Whilst agreeing with the Leninist assumption of the French Communist Party that 'communist consciousness' does not spontaneously arise amongst the working class, it disagreed that the solution to this problem was the party 'bringing that consciousness to the class'. Instead it drew upon the narrative forms of the workers inquiry developed by the JFT with the view that "the worker narrative could express the proletarian experience in such a way as to make its embedded socialist content appear".

For the JFT, however, it was the self-articulation of the working class, in its various forms, that would enable what they called the 'invading socialist society' to develop, whilst for the SOB the idea that a socialist society was an historical inevitability underlay the work of the JFT and they argued that such an inevitability was invalid. In doing so the SOB heightened the importance of the role of theory and the intellectual. Both groups worked closely together, however, in trying to develop new journalistic and narrative forms for revolutionary struggle and both struggled with how to articulate and overcome the perceived division between theory and practice that Lenin had articulated.

## Fourth Moment: Danilo Montaldi and Italian Operaismo (1950s-60s)

In 1954 the Italian communist Danilo Montaldi translated the 'The American Worker' from the French version produced by SOB. Montaldi worked closely with SOB for a while but began to develop the workers inquiry in new directions. Montaldi, having been expelled from the Italian Communist Party (PCI), formed a group called the Gruppo di Unita Proletaria in Cremona, Italy, that lasted from 1957 through 1962 and brought together a number of people interested in direct working class experience unmediated through the form of the PCI.

Montaldi developed the workers inquiry into a pluralistic method, using multiple techniques that produced influential results at a time of massive social change within Italian society that involved mass industrialisation and huge population movements from South to North. It is at this point that the Leninist problematic that had dominated the role of the workers inquiry within the JFT and the SOB shifts.

Sergio Bologna, a key figure in the Italian 'autonomia' movement of the early 1970's that develops in large measure out of the 'operaismo' moment of the late 1960's, argues that Montaldi is the key figure in a major methodological shift. In particular this reconfigures the relation between the figure of the 'political activist' that constitutes what Bologna refers to as a 'political elite' and the militants of the 'mass movement', what might more broadly be conceived of as the relation between the party 'intelligentsia' and the trade union 'militant'.

In particular Montaldi doesn't articulate the two figures as active 'party' versus passive 'working class' but instead argues that the idea of a 'spontaneous' struggle is illusory. Working class struggles are not spontaneous expressions from an otherwise passive force in society but are already highly articulated forms of political knowledge. It is not a matter of knowledge, in the form of the party, being brought to bear on desires, in the form of the working class.

As Bologna describes it:

"What we could call 'spontaneity' is, in reality, the formation of microsystems of struggle which are already very mature politically, because they have been determined by a generation of militants who came from the Resistance. Or else, they were worker militants who had already been trade union leaders, who broke individually and gradually, in silence, with the unions, and developed their own autonomy. But they are people, they are a generation and therefore, perhaps, also a kind of political elite, already very mature."

It is within this context that the work of the operaismo (workerist) tendency of Alquati, Tronti, Negri et al develops.

## Romano Alquati and Co-Research

Romano Alquati, one of the founders of italian 'operaismo' alongside others such as Mario Tronti and Toni Negri, brought Montaldi's ideas into the Italian 'new left' that was forming in the 1960's and contesting the power of the PCI in working class life. A key component of this new left was the workerist tendency, operaismo. Its own stated purpose is to investigate the transformations of the working class subject in the face of the rise of mass industrialisation in Italy and to develop what Tronti will call the partisan 'point of view'.

The inquiry, in this situation, conceives a fundamental epistemological incommensurability between the world from the point of view of the working class and from the point of view of the 'collective capitalist'. Romano Alquati explicitly develops this in terms of what he calls **'co-research'**. This consists of at least two key moments:

1. **A relational moment** where the 'objectivity' of the researcher (or party) is not fixed but develops in relation with the 'subject' of research
2. **Research as resistance** where the intention of the research is not an 'objectivity in the abstract' but rather as resistance

"Against the knowledge that capital uses to govern, coresearch develops a counter-knowledge"

## Towards a Fifth Moment: Some Possible Lessons

If contemporary 'social inquiry' takes its inspiration from the 'workers inquiry' then it is a rich history with much to investigate in terms of methodology and practice. The development of the tactic offers a history of attempts to grapple with a theory-practice problematic that moves through the Leninist problematic, from before Lenin, with Marx and the french La Revue Socialiste attempts to instigate social reform, to a post-Lenin moment encapsulated in Alquati's 'co-research as counter-knowledge'.

Overall the JFT and the SOB appear to offer dynamics that are away from the tendency, on the part of 'traditional Leninism', to assume the Party as the fount of knowledge or 'active subjectivity' towards a more dynamic and less hierarchical knowledge relation.

### Contemporary Considerations

In many ways similar conditions such as those in Italy exist at the current moment, with major shifts in population and in the organisation of production. One notable exception perhaps is the existence in Italy of key layers of 'organic militants' that Bologna notes had derived from the Italian resistance. It may be interesting to investigate whether something similar exists currently, whether a layer of militants from the seventies and eighties has left an influence on contemporary militants involved in struggle.

Part of the reason for the demise of the workerist organisations was their poor relationship to feminism and in particular to issues of social reproduction. This is a difference from the Italian situation in that issues of social reproduction inform the concept of the 'social strike' and thus are central to understanding the development of struggles centred around that concept. Again, in terms of specific elements of the inquiry, this does suggest that specific questions aiming to explore how socially reproductive elements inform social resistance would be useful.

### The Challenge of Co-Research Today

If we take the 'social strike' to be a response to the changing forms of production then the role of the social inquiry, if understood as co-research, is analogous to that of the workers inquiry in the Italian situation. At the same time the situation has changed. Not least, the 'production of counter-knowledge' is now far more recuperated by the academy than before and whether and why a project of social inquiry is not best carried out from within the academy does seem to need articulating.

If the project of social inquiry is posed arbitrarily outside of academic structure the danger is that it falls back into a kind of territoriality, whereby its a cipher for a political elite rather than an academic one. The lessons of co-research seem crucial here but one thing noted by Alquati is the time required for engagement with co-research. To enable a process of reciprocal determination, whereby there is a relation of change between the 'inquired upon' and the 'inquirers', suggest that the project needs to perceive itself as having an open horizon that can continue rather than be modelled in the form of a brief 'field trip'.
