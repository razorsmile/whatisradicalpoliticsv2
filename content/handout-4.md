**IN THE STATE:** Working through electoral politics, policy, and state institutions to achieve radical goals. The state has unique power to redistribute resources and reshape society.

**AGAINST THE STATE:** Confronting state power through resistance, disruption, and refusal. The state is fundamentally an instrument of domination that cannot be reformed.

**BEYOND THE STATE:** Building parallel institutions and counter-power outside state control. We must create new forms of social organization rather than seizing existing ones.
