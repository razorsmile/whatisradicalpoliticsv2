## Where to Look

### Official Archives (read against the grain):

- Local records offices
- Museums and art galleries
- History centers and libraries

### Alternative Sources:

- Oral history projects
- Union archives and records
- Radical newspapers and zines
- Personal collections and family stories

## Questions to Ask

1. Whose voices are missing from official accounts?
2. What patterns of resistance existed?
3. How did ordinary people organize?
4. What succeeded and what failed? Why?
5. What can we learn and adapt today?

## Methods

- **Oral History:** Interview participants while alive
- **Place-Based:** What happened on your street?
- **Counter-Reading:** What do hostile sources reveal?
- **Pattern Seeking:** Look for recurring tactics/strategies
