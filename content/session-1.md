## Overview

This session explores the philosophical meaning of 'radical' (going to the root) and introduces six major radical traditions: socialism, anarchism, communism, feminism, anti-racist/anti-colonial thought, and ecological politics. We emphasize these as living traditions in conversation and tension with each other.

<div class="section-block highlight-section">

## What Does 'Radical' Mean?

Etymologically, 'radical' comes from the Latin 'radix' - meaning root. Radical politics means going to the root causes of problems, not just addressing symptoms.

<div class="example-box">

#### Local Example: Homelessness

**Non-radical approach:** Build more shelters, provide more services

**Radical approach:** Why does homelessness exist? What systems create it? How might we reorganize society to eliminate it entirely?

</div>

This 'going to the root' can mean:

- **Structural** change not reform
- **Systemic** analysis not individual blame
- **Transformative** not symptom focused
- **Collective** solutions not individual fixes

</div>

## Six Major Radical Traditions

<p class="intro-text">These aren't separate menu items you choose from - they're in constant conversation and tension with each other. Many people and movements draw from multiple traditions.</p>

<div class="traditions-grid">

<div class="tradition-card">

### 1. Socialism

**Root Problem:** Private ownership of means of production, unregulated capitalism

**Solution:** Collective ownership, democratic planning

**Local Example:** Campaigns for council house improvements, ACORN, Your Party's advocacy for public utilities

### 2. Anarchism

**Root Problem:** Hierarchy and coercive authority

**Solution:** Horizontal organization, mutual aid

**Local Example:** Radical social spaces, Foodbanks, squatting movements, anti-raids organsation

### 3. Communism

**Root Problem:** Capitalist class society

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

## Productive Tensions

These traditions don't exist in isolation. They can have different kinds of relationships with each other, sometimes productive, othertimes conflicting. Their tensions push our thinking forward:

<div class="tensions-list">

<div class="tension-item">

#### Socialist & Feminist Debates

Is class or gender the primary oppression? How do they intersect?

</div>

<div class="tension-item">

#### Anarchist & Communist Tensions

Can we use state power for liberation or does it always corrupt?

</div>

<div class="tension-item">

#### Anti-racist & Socialist Conversations

Is socialism a European framework imposed globally or a universal tool for liberation?

</div>

<div class="tension-item">

#### Ecological & Socialist Synthesis

Can we have sustainable socialism or does industrialism itself need dismantling?

</div>

</div>
