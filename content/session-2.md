## Overview

This session examines three strategic orientations toward the state using concrete examples. 'In' (democratic socialism, Green Party), 'Against' (direct action, squatting), and 'Beyond' (prefigurative politics, dual power). We use housing as a running example throughout.

## The Strategic Triangle

Tonight's framework comes from the phrase used by various movements: "In, Against, and Beyond the State." These aren't mutually exclusive strategies - many movements combine them.

<div class="example-box">

**IN THE STATE** 🏛️ | **AGAINST** ✊ | **BEYOND** 🌱

Working through electoral politics and state institutions | Confronting state power through resistance and disruption | Building parallel institutions and counter-power

## Three Strategic Orientations

<div class="traditions-grid">

<div class="tradition-card">

### IN THE STATE

Working through electoral politics, policy, and state institutions to achieve radical goals.

**Logic:** The state has unique power to redistribute resources and reshape society

**Methods:**
- Elections and electoral campaigns
- Legislation and policy reform
- Public ownership of services
- Welfare systems and social programs

**Risks:**
- Co-optation by existing power structures
- Bureaucratization of movements
- Limits of parliamentary democracy
- Compromise and moderation pressures


</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### AGAINST THE STATE

Confronting state power through resistance, disruption, and refusal.

**Logic:** The state is fundamentally an instrument of domination that cannot be reformed

**Methods:**
- Direct action and civil disobedience
- Strikes and industrial action
- Blockades and occupations
- Squatting and reclamation

**Risks:**
- State repression and criminalization
- Marginalization from broader public
- Inability to build alternatives at scale
- Burnout from constant confrontation


</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### BEYOND THE STATE

Building parallel institutions and counter-power outside state control.

**Logic:** We must create new forms of social organization rather than seizing existing ones

**Methods:**
- Cooperatives and mutual aid networks
- Community land trusts
- Alternative currencies and economies
- Autonomous social centers

**Risks:**
- Isolation from wider society
- Lack of resources for scaling
- Vulnerability to state intervention
- Becoming lifestyle politics

## Housing Crisis Case Study

Let's apply this framework to the housing crisis to see how each orientation offers different approaches (you might want to explore a different example depending on your context - the point is to think about the example through the categories of 'in, against and beyond'):

<div class="example-box">

#### Research the problem - what is your local Housing Context

- Average house price? How many times the local average salary is it?
- Average rent? What portion of the average wage does it make up?
- How many people on the local council house list?  What's the average waiting time?
- How many rough sleepers in your town or city?

</div>

<div class="tensions-list">
<p>Now look at proposed solutions and try and decide which kind of strategy they are using:</P>
<div class="tension-item">

#### IN: a political party's Housing Platform

- Rent controls and tenant protections
- Mass council housing construction
- Community right to buy
- Wealth taxes to fund social housing

This assumes we can win electoral power and use the state to decommodify housing.

</div>

<div class="tension-item">

#### AGAINST: Direct Action Approaches

- Rent strikes and eviction resistance
- Squatting empty properties
- Blocking estate agent offices
- Disrupting property developer meetings

This takes over empty buildings directly to house rough sleepers despite legal threats.

</div>

<div class="tension-item">

#### BEYOND: Alternative Models

- Community Land Trusts
- Housing cooperatives
- Mutual aid networks for housing support
- Self-build projects

These create non-commodified housing outside market and state systems.

</div>

</div>

<div class="example-box">

#### Historical Example: 1915 Glasgow Rent Strikes

Most effective movements combine strategies. The Glasgow Rent Strikes used:

- **AGAINST:** Strike tactics and direct confrontation
- **IN:** Won rent control legislation
- **BEYOND:** Built lasting tenants' organizations

</div>

</div>

<div class="section-block">

## Strategic Debates

These orientations raise crucial questions for radical movements:

**The Parliamentary Road?**

Can we vote our way to socialism? Your Party says yes with the right movement behind it. Critics point to Chile's Allende, Greece's Syriza - radical governments crushed or co-opted.

**Diversity of Tactics?**

Should movements combine all three orientations or does that dilute focus? Some argue for 'dual power' - building counter-institutions while also engaging electoral politics.

**Prefiguration vs Power?**

Do we focus on modeling the future society now (beyond) or seizing levers of change (in)? Do means determine ends?

**Local vs National?**

Brighton City Council has limited powers. Can municipal socialism work within national constraints? Or must change happen at every scale simultaneously?

## Discussion Questions

<ol class="discussion-questions">

<li>Where do you see Your Party on this triangle? Is it purely 'in' or does it engage other orientations?</li>
<li>What examples from your own experience combine these strategies?</li>
<li>Is working 'in' the state always reformist or can it be revolutionary?</li>
<li>How do we avoid the traps of each orientation?</li>
<li>Which orientation feels most comfortable to you? Which feels most challenging?</li>

</ol>

## Optional Task

### For Next Week

Research a specific event, movement, or figure from your local town or cities radical traditions (every place has something to find). Consider:

- Which strategic orientation(s) did they use?
- What successes and failures did they experience?
- What can we learn from their approach?
- How might their tactics work (or not work) today?
