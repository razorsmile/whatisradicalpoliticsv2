## Overview

This session develops skills in radical historiography by examining local historical struggles. We'll explore how to research our community's radical past, understand patterns across different movements, and connect historical struggles to present-day organising. The examples given are from Brighton - adapt these frameworks to investigate our own area's history of resistance.

## The Hidden Transcript

Encourage the use of this concept of the hidden transcript when participants are doing their local history. It is also something that can be explored in terms of participants own experiences - we all have an example of a hidden transcript in our own lives that we can think of.

The concept is drawn from James C. Scott - **Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts.** New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1990.

The text is freely available and can be read [here](https://libcom.org/article/domination-and-arts-resistance-hidden-transcripts-james-c-scott).

............

The concept of the **hidden transcript** refers to the political discourse, including speeches, gestures, and practices, that takes place **"offstage," beyond direct observation by powerholders**. It is distinguished from the "public transcript," which describes the open interaction between subordinates and those who dominate.

A hidden transcript is created by every subordinate group and **represents a critique of power spoken behind the back of the dominant**. This critique is developed in private settings where mutual communication is possible, outside the immediate control of those in power. Because it is generated under different constraints, the hidden transcript is the **privileged site for nonhegemonic, contrapuntal, dissident, [and] subversive discourse**. It reflects assertions of anger, aggression, and hostility that are typically thwarted or suppressed in the face of domination out of prudence, fear, and the desire to curry favour. Although hidden from the dominant, the transcript is sometimes expressed openly, albeit in a **disguised form**.

An example of a hidden transcript is illustrated by the experience of **Aggy, a black slave cook**. Aggy typically maintained a public transcript of quiet obedience and was normally taciturn and deferential. However, after witnessing the master beat her daughter, she confided in a trusted white acquaintance, Mary Livermore, revealing a starkly different outlook. Aggy's hidden transcript was a forceful **"finely drawn and highly visual image of an apocalypse, a day of revenge and triumph,"** depicting a "world turned upside down" using religious imagery, which was completely at odds with her public deference.

## Why Radical History Matters

History isn't neutral - what gets remembered, how it's told, who tells it - these are political questions.

**Inspiration:** Seeing ordinary people achieve extraordinary things

**Learning:** Understanding what worked, what didn't, and why

**Connection:** Realizing we're part of a longer struggle

**Resources:** Discovering tactics, strategies, and models we can adapt

<div class="example-box">

#### Radical Historiography Means:

- Centering marginalized voices
- Looking for patterns of resistance
- Questioning official narratives
- Finding hidden transcripts of struggle

Every place has a hidden history of resistance beneath official narratives.

## Three Historical Case Studies

**Note:** These examples are from Brighton. Research similar moments in our own locality - unemployed workers' movements, squatting/housing struggles, and mass civil disobedience campaigns have occurred in most communities.

<div class="traditions-grid">

<div class="tradition-card">

### Example 1: Unemployed Workers' Movements (1930s)

During the Great Depression, organised unemployment movements combined direct action with mutual aid to resist destitution.

**Typical Tactics:**
- Mass marches to local government offices
- Occupations of relief offices
- Direct action to prevent evictions
- Mutual aid including communal kitchens

**Brighton Example - Battle of Church Street (1934):**

12,000 unemployed workers organised locally. On May Day 1934, 3,000 marched demanding "work or full maintenance." Police attacked, triggering street battles. The movement won increased relief rates and stopped many evictions.

**Key Lessons:**
- Combined 'against' tactics (confrontation) with 'beyond' (mutual aid)
- Connected immediate needs to systemic critique
- Built solidarity across employed/unemployed divide

Slogan: "We Refuse to Starve in Silence"

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### Example 2: Squatting Movements (1970s)

During housing crises, squatting movements transformed empty buildings into communities while challenging property relations.

**Typical Practices:**
- Occupation of empty properties
- Creation of legal support networks
- Building alternative institutions (nurseries, co-ops, newspapers)
- Linking housed and unhoused through solidarity networks

**Brighton Example (1975):**

Over 500 squatters occupied 3,000+ empty properties. They created squatters' handbooks, food co-ops, and community newspapers. The state responded with the 1977 Criminal Law Act criminalizing residential squatting.

**Legacy:**

Many current housing co-ops originated as squats. The model of direct action for housing continues.

<div class="tradition-card">

### Example 3: Mass Civil Disobedience (Poll Tax 1989-1991)

Coordinated refusal to comply with unjust laws can achieve major victories when combined with mutual support structures.

**Typical Elements:**
- Mass non-compliance with specific law
- Regular organising meetings
- Mutual aid and legal support networks
- Community defense against enforcement
- Clear demands linking to broader critique

**Brighton Example:**

30,000 refused to pay (20% of those liable). Weekly meetings at unemployed centers, mass rallies, phone trees to resist bailiffs, court solidarity.

**Success Factors:**
- Unity across class lines
- Clear demand: abolition not reform
- Practical solidarity

The tax was abolished in 1991. Proof that collective refusal works.

## Patterns Across These Struggles

**Successful Tactics:**

- Direct action combined with mutual aid
- Clear demands linked to systemic critique
- Practical solidarity not just symbolic support
- Creating alternative institutions while fighting existing ones

## How to Research Radical History

**Oral History**

Interview participants while they're alive. Get their stories before they're lost.

**Alternative Archives**

Union records, radical newspapers, personal collections often tell different stories than official archives.

**Read Against the Grain**

What do hostile sources reveal? Police reports and conservative newspapers often document resistance they oppose.

**Place-Based Investigation**

What happened on your street? Every neighborhood has hidden histories of struggle.

**Question Absences**

Whose stories are missing? Women, people of color, LGBTQ+ folks often erased from official accounts.

**Consider the hidden transcript**

What's the context of the stories being told?  Is what is said part of the hidden or the public transcript? 

<div class="example-box">

#### Your Research Matters

Official history won't preserve these stories - we must. Every interview, every document saved, every story shared keeps our radical heritage alive.

## Creating Your Local Radical Timeline

**Your task:** Research and create a timeline of radical struggles in your area. Look for:

- Labor strikes and organising
- Housing and land struggles
- Anti-war and international solidarity movements
- Civil rights and liberation movements
- Environmental resistance
- Feminist and LGBTQ+ organising
- Anti-austerity campaigns

**Example Timeline Format:**

- **1820s:** Agricultural workers' resistance (Swing Riots)
- **1911:** Women's suffrage demonstrations
- **1926:** General Strike - transport workers lead
- **1934:** Unemployed Workers Movement
- **1970s:** Squatting movement peaks
- **1984-85:** Miners' Strike solidarity
- **1990-91:** Poll Tax resistance
- **2011:** Occupy movement
- **2019:** School climate strikes

*Adapt this framework to document your own area's history of resistance.*

## Discussion Questions

<ol class="discussion-questions">

<li>Which historical tactics could work today? Which couldn't and why?</li>
<li>What's different about organising now versus 50 or 90 years ago in your area?</li>
<li>How do we ensure today's struggles become tomorrow's inspiring history?</li>
<li>What stories of resistance from your own family or community should be preserved?</li>
<li>What patterns do you see across different historical moments in your locality?</li>

</ol>

</div>

## Optional Task

### For Next Week

Identify ONE site of counter-power in your locality today. This could be:

- A mutual aid project (food banks, community fridges, solidarity networks)
- A self-organised space (social centers, community gardens, occupied spaces)
- Alternative economy (cooperatives, time banks, commons)
- Knowledge commons (radical libraries, skill shares, study groups)

**Local examples:** Food banks, community centers, community gardens, time banks

Be ready to place it on our collective map and explain its significance.
