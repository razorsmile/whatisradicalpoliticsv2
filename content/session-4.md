## Overview

Our final session introduces the Italian workerist tradition of 'inchiesta operaia' (workers' inquiry) and conricerca (co-research). We collectively map mutual aid networks, self-organized projects, and community infrastructure in our locality, creating a physical resource. This session adapts examples from Brighton - replace with our own local sites of counter-power.

There is a short history of the workers inquiry and its contemporary relevance in Handout 11 if you want to explore it some more.

## Workers' Inquiry and Co-Research

In 1960s Italy, radical sociologists developed new methods for understanding working-class power. They rejected studying workers as objects, instead practicing co-research - workers and intellectuals investigating together.

### Workers' Inquiry Asks:

- How do workers resist exploitation daily?
- What informal organization exists?
- Where is potential power located?
- How does struggle circulate and spread?

### Co-Research (Conricerca) Means:

- Research WITH not ON people
- Combining investigation and organization
- Knowledge production as political intervention
- Breaking down researcher/subject divide

<div class="example-box">

#### Historical Example: Romano Alquati at FIAT

Alquati's study of FIAT factories revealed invisible workers' networks:

- Informal communication systems that bypassed management
- Sabotage practices that slowed production
- Solidarity structures union officials didn't even know existed
- Knowledge that became the basis for autonomous workers' movements

We'll apply this method to your locality - but expanding 'workers' to include all sites of working-class life: workplaces, neighborhoods, communities of struggle.

## Four Categories of Counter-Power

<div class="traditions-grid four-plus-one">

<div class="tradition-card">

### 1. Mutual Aid Networks

Direct, horizontal support systems that meet immediate needs while building solidarity.

**Examples of mutual aid:**
- Direct action unions and solidarity networks
- Community fridges and food banks
- Informal childcare networks and parent cooperatives
- Mental health peer support groups
- Migrant solidarity organizations

**What Makes This Counter-Power?**

These networks demonstrate we can meet our needs without the state or market, building solidarity through practice not ideology.

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### 2. Self-Organized Spaces

Physical infrastructure controlled by communities - because space is power.

**Types of self-organized spaces:**
- Radical social centers
- Community-owned pubs and cafes
- Black and minority ethnic community spaces
- Community gardens and urban agriculture
- Squatted social centers (when active)

**What Makes This Counter-Power?**

Control over space means ability to organize, meet, plan, and build community outside surveillance and market relations.

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### 3. Alternative Economies

Non-capitalist forms of exchange demonstrating other ways of organizing production and distribution.

**Forms of alternative economy:**
- Local exchange trading systems (LETS)
- Credit unions - community-controlled finance
- Worker cooperatives
- Time banks - hour-for-hour skill exchange
- Free shops and gift economies

**What Makes This Counter-Power?**

These demonstrate production and exchange can be organized by principles of cooperation not competition, need not profit.

</div>

<div class="tradition-card">

### 4. Knowledge Commons

Collective learning and information sharing - because knowledge is power when collectively held.

**Types of knowledge commons:**
- Radical lending libraries and free book exchanges
- Know Your Rights trainings - legal knowledge shared
- Community research projects
- Alternative media and community publishing
- Skill shares - teaching practical skills freely

**What Makes This Counter-Power?**

Breaking the monopoly on knowledge production and distribution, creating our own narratives and analyses.

### We Are The Multitude - a new way to understand our class
 
Philosopher Antonio Negri uses "the multitude" to describe not a unified working class but a plural, diverse formation of all who labor under capital. Counter-power exists wherever the multitude self-organizes: in workplaces, homes, streets, and digital spaces. These four categories are examples of how the multitude builds capacity for collective self-determination.

## Mapping Exercise

Now we create our own map of counter-power. This isn't academic exercise - it's practical resource building.

### Your Research Task

Think of ONE site of counter-power you know about. Answer:

1. **What is it?** (name, location, function)
2. **Who participates?** (demographics, numbers)
3. **How does it operate?** (structure, decision-making)
4. **What needs does it meet?**
5. **What potential does it have?**
6. **How could it connect to other sites?**

This could be:

- Your workplace (informal organization, not official unions)
- Your neighborhood (WhatsApp groups, support networks)
- Communities you're part of (identity-based, interest-based)
- Projects you know about

**We're looking for ACTUAL organization, not theoretical potential.**

<div class="example-box">

#### Creating Your Map

In the actual session, participants add their sites to a physical map with colored pins or sticky notes representing each category.  The map can be made from a photocopy, or drawn as a rough digram on a large sheet of paper - be creative.  This is a way for comrades to get familiar with their local space and what already exists:

- **Blue:** Mutual Aid Networks
- **Green:** Self-Organized Spaces
- **Yellow:** Alternative Economies
- **Red:** Knowledge Commons

This visual representation reveals the existing infrastructure of counter-power in your locality.

## From Mapping to Movement

### What This Map Reveals

- Working-class power already exists - it's just not always visible
- Counter-power exists alongside electoral strategies
- The infrastructure for transformation is being built now

### Strategic Questions

- Could these sites be connected into stronger networks?
- What would coordination without centralization look like?
- How does this relate to electoral organizing?
- Can we scale these models without losing their radical character?

</div>

<div class="section-block highlight-section">

## The Work Continues

### This Map is Yours

Take photos, share it, use it. Add to it. This is co-research in practice.

The map we create together becomes:

- A resource for finding solidarity and support
- A tool for strategic planning
- Evidence of existing alternatives
- The basis for building stronger networks

**"This is the working-class not as victims but as agents"**

## Discussion Questions

<ol class="discussion-questions">

<li>How does this map change how you see your locality?</li>
<li>What connections between sites could be strengthened?</li>
<li>What's missing from our map? What gaps exist?</li>
<li>How does counter-power relate to electoral strategies?</li>
<li>What's our next step with this knowledge?</li>

</ol>

## Course Conclusion

### What We've Built Together

Over four weeks, we've developed analytical tools:

- **Philosophical:** Understanding radical traditions and their tensions
- **Political:** Analyzing relationships to state power
- **Historical:** Learning from local radical history
- **Sociological:** Mapping actually existing counter-power

These aren't abstract ideas but practical tools. The question isn't whether radical change is possible - our history and present mapping show it is. The question is how we organize to make it happen.
