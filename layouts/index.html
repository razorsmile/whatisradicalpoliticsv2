        <h3>Why This Course?</h3>
        <p>In response to growing interest in radical politics, this course provides critical thinking tools rather than campaign training or argumentation techniques.</p>
        <p>This course focuses on understanding multiple radical traditions, developing analytical tools, grounding theory in local contexts, and building collective knowledge through co-research.</p>
        <p>It also emphasises the plurality of radical politics in order to try and move away from the potential disappointment and disillusionment that can come from encountering sometimes heated debates within the left.  The goal is to suggest that disagreement and difference are not to be a source of division but a source of strength and learning.</p>

        <h3>Course Philosophy</h3>
        <p><strong>Experience-Based:</strong> Participants are co-educators. We draw on existing knowledge and lived experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Locally Grounded:</strong> Sessions connect to your community's specific history, present conditions, and possibilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Practically Oriented:</strong> We create tangible resources like counter-power maps and research networks.</p>
        <p><strong>Pluralistic:</strong> We explore diverse radical traditions to embrace disagreement as a source of strength.</p>
        <p><strong>Accessible:</strong> No prior academic background is assumed. Left-wing and academic jargon is explained to enable new comrades to become familiar with the language of the left without developing an anti-intellectualism.</p>

        <h3>Using The Course Materials</h3>
        <p>All materials are freely available to copy, share, and adapt for non-commercial political education.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Facilitators:</strong> Read the <a href="/materials/">Facilitators Guide</a>, adapt materials to your local context and share improvements</li>
          <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Form study groups and apply tools in your organising practice</li>
          <li><strong>Organisations:</strong> Run the course in your community and create local versions</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> use the jargon buster as a notepad and reference guide during the course.</li>
          <li><strong>Session pages:</strong> use the Session pages instead of having to have Powerpoint slides.</li>
          <li><strong>Scripts:</strong> use the provided scripts as basic lesson plans you can adapt.</li>
          <li><strong>Maps:</strong> create the maps from Sessions 3 & 4 and use as a tool to understand local power dynamics.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Using the Course</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The idea for the course is that it is a tool for outreach.  It is designed to be used to create a space for facilitated conversation in a <strong>convivial</strong> setting.</li>
          <li> Imagine doing a listening exercise in a local community where you're introducing yourselves as local organisers and aiming to develop some community organising work.  This course could be used as a 'next step' to offer people on the doorstep when you've finished your questions.</li>  
          <li>Or it could be run as a local group activity that can be offered to a street or neighbourhood, or as a way to promote healthy political discussion within a small group of party activists. It's a tool, and if it has a use you will find it.</li>
        </ul>
