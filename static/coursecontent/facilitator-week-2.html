    <h1>Week 2 Facilitator Script</h1>
    <p>This is a script for the second week of the Radical Education course. It is designed to help facilitators run the session effectively.</p>
    

    <h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

    <h5>Opening & Recap (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Welcome back. Last week we explored six radical traditions. Tonight we're examining how different traditions relate to state power - arguably THE central strategic question for radical politics.</p>
        <p>Who brought research to share? We'll hear those in hour two.</p>
        <p>First, let's briefly check in: what stayed with you from last week?"</p>
        <p>[2-3 brief shares]</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Part 1: Three Orientations to the State (20 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Tonight's framework comes from a phrase used by various movements: 'In, Against, and Beyond the State.' These aren't mutually exclusive strategies - many movements combine them."</p>
        <p>[Draw triangle on flipchart with three points labeled]</p>
        <p><strong>IN THE STATE</strong><br>
        Working through electoral politics, policy, and state institutions to achieve radical goals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logic:</strong> The state has unique power to redistribute resources and reshape society</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Elections, legislation, public ownership, welfare systems</li>
            <li><strong>Brighton examples:</strong> Your Party councilors, Greens implementing community wealth building</li>
            <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Co-optation, bureaucratization, limits of parliamentary democracy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>AGAINST THE STATE</strong><br>
        Confronting state power through resistance, disruption, and refusal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logic:</strong> The state is fundamentally an instrument of domination that cannot be reformed</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Direct action, strikes, blockades, squatting, civil disobedience</li>
            <li><strong>Brighton examples:</strong> Anti-raids networks, squatting movements, poll tax resistance</li>
            <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Repression, marginalization, inability to build alternatives</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>BEYOND THE STATE</strong><br>
        Building parallel institutions and counter-power outside state control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logic:</strong> We must create new forms of social organization rather than seizing existing ones</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Cooperatives, mutual aid networks, community land trusts, alternative currencies</li>
            <li><strong>Brighton examples:</strong> Brighton Food Co-op, community gardens, time banks</li>
            <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Isolation, lack of resources, limited scale</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These orientations reflect different theories of power and change."</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Part 2: The Housing Crisis as Case Study (20 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Let's apply this framework to Brighton's housing crisis. Some context:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Average house price: £525,000 (15x average salary)</li>
            <li>Average rent: £1,800/month for 2-bed</li>
            <li>2,000+ on council housing waiting list</li>
            <li>150+ rough sleepers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How might each orientation address this?</p>
        <p><strong>IN THE STATE - Your Party's Housing Platform:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rent controls and tenant protections</li>
            <li>Mass council housing construction</li>
            <li>Community right to buy</li>
            <li>Wealth taxes to fund social housing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This assumes we can win electoral power and use the state to decommodify housing.</p>
        <p><strong>AGAINST THE STATE - Direct Action Approaches:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rent strikes and eviction resistance</li>
            <li>Squatting empty properties</li>
            <li>Blocking estate agent offices</li>
            <li>Disrupting property developer meetings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Autonomous Winter Shelter in Brighton operated on these principles - occupying empty buildings to house rough sleepers despite legal threats.</p>
        <p><strong>BEYOND THE STATE - Alternative Models:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Community Land Trusts (like Brighton's Bunker Housing Co-op)</li>
            <li>Housing cooperatives</li>
            <li>Mutual aid networks for housing support</li>
            <li>Self-build projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These create non-commodified housing outside market and state systems.</p>
        <p>Most effective movements combine strategies. The 1915 Glasgow Rent Strikes used 'against' tactics (strikes) to win 'in' victories (rent controls) while building 'beyond' structures (tenants' organizations)."</p>

    <h5>Part 3: Strategic Debates (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"These orientations raise crucial debates:</p>
        <p><strong>The Parliamentary Road?</strong><br>
        Can we vote our way to socialism? Your Party says yes with the right movement behind it. Critics point to Chile's Allende, Greece's Syriza - radical governments crushed or co-opted.</p>
        <p><strong>Diversity of Tactics?</strong><br>
        Should movements combine all three orientations or does that dilute focus? Some argue for 'dual power' - building counter-institutions while also engaging electoral politics.</p>
        <p><strong>Prefiguration vs Power?</strong><br>
        Do we focus on modeling the future society now (beyond) or seizing levers of change (in)? Do means determine ends?</p>
        <p><strong>Local vs National?</strong><br>
        Brighton City Council has limited powers. Can municipal socialism work within national constraints? Or must change happen at every scale simultaneously?"</p>
    </div>

    <h4>HOUR 2: Open Discussion (60 mins)</h4>

    <h5>Jargon Buster (5 mins)</h5>
    <p><strong>Key Terms for Session 2:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The state:</strong> Government institutions plus military, police, courts, bureaucracy</li>
        <li><strong>Civil society:</strong> Organizations and relationships outside state and market</li>
        <li><strong>Dual power:</strong> Alternative institutions competing with state authority</li>
        <li><strong>Prefigurative politics:</strong> Organizing in ways that embody desired future</li>
        <li><strong>Recuperation:</strong> System's ability to absorb and neutralize radical challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Self-governance independent of state control</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Participant Research Sharing (15 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Who researched something to share? Remember, 2 minutes each."</p>
        <p>[Keep time strictly, thank each person, note themes on flipchart]</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Small Group Exercise: Strategy Mapping (20 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Form groups of 3-4. Choose a specific issue in Brighton:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homelessness</li>
            <li>Low wages</li>
            <li>Climate crisis</li>
            <li>NHS privatization</li>
            <li>Police violence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Design a campaign using ALL THREE orientations. What would you do in, against, and beyond the state? How would these strategies support each other?"</p>
        <p>[15 mins small group work]</p>
        <p>[5 mins report back - each group shares one insight]</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Open Discussion (20 mins)</h5>
    <p><strong>Discussion Prompts:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>"Where do you see Your Party on this triangle? Is it purely 'in' or does it engage other orientations?"</li>
        <li>"What examples from your own experience combine these strategies?"</li>
        <li>"Is working 'in' the state always reformist or can it be revolutionary?"</li>
        <li>"How do we avoid the traps of each orientation?"</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script for Closing:</strong></p>
        <p>"Next week we'll dig into Brighton's radical history - learning how previous generations navigated these strategic questions. If you want to contribute, research a specific event, movement, or figure from Brighton's radical past. We'll build our collective knowledge together."</p>
