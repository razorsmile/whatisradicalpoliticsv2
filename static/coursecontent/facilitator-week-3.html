    <h1>Week 3 Facilitator Script</h1>
    <p>This is a script for the third week of the Radical Education course. It is designed to help facilitators run the session effectively.</p>
    
    <h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

    <h5>Opening (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Tonight we become historians of Brighton's radical past. History isn't neutral - what gets remembered, how it's told, who tells it - these are political questions. We'll explore three historical moments, then build our collective knowledge.</p>
        <p>But first - who researched Brighton radical history to share?"</p>
        <p>[Note names for hour two]</p>

    <h5>Part 1: Why Radical History Matters (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Why study radical history locally?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Seeing ordinary people achieve extraordinary things</li>
            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Understanding what worked, what didn't, and why</li>
            <li><strong>Connection:</strong> Realizing we're part of a longer struggle</li>
            <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Discovering tactics, strategies, and models we can adapt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Radical historiography means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Centering marginalized voices</li>
            <li>Looking for patterns of resistance</li>
            <li>Questioning official narratives</li>
            <li>Finding hidden transcripts of struggle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Brighton's tourist-friendly image obscures a rich history of resistance."</p>

    <h5>Part 2: Three Brighton Moments (30 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1. THE 1934 BRIGHTON UNEMPLOYED WORKERS' MOVEMENT (10 mins)</strong></p>
        <p>"During the Great Depression, Brighton had 12,000 unemployed workers. The National Unemployed Workers' Movement, led locally by Bert Santley, organized:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mass marches to the Town Hall</li>
            <li>Occupations of relief offices</li>
            <li>Direct action to prevent evictions</li>
            <li>Mutual aid including communal kitchens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On May Day 1934, 3,000 marched through Brighton demanding work or full maintenance. Police attacked with batons, triggering the 'Battle of Church Street.'</p>
        <p>Key lessons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combined 'against' tactics (confrontation) with 'beyond' (mutual aid)</li>
            <li>Connected immediate needs to systemic critique</li>
            <li>Built solidarity across employed/unemployed divide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The movement won increased relief rates and stopped many evictions. Their slogan: 'We Refuse to Starve in Silence.'"</p>
        <p><strong>2. THE 1970s BRIGHTON SQUATTING MOVEMENT (10 mins)</strong></p>
        <p>"By 1975, Brighton had over 500 squatters while 3,000 properties stood empty. The movement wasn't just about housing - it was prefigurative politics in action.</p>
        <p>Key occupied spaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Richmond: Squatted hotel becoming housing co-op</li>
            <li>Wykeham Terrace: Row of mansions turned into commune</li>
            <li>Multiple empty office blocks converted to homes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Squatters' handbook and legal support network</li>
            <li>Children's nurseries and food cooperatives</li>
            <li>The Brighton Voice - radical community newspaper</li>
            <li>Networks linking housed and unhoused solidarity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The 1977 Criminal Law Act criminalized squatting in residential buildings - direct state response to the movement's success.</p>
        <p>Legacy: Several current housing co-ops originated as squats. The model of taking direct action for housing needs continues today."</p>
        <p><strong>3. BRIGHTON AGAINST THE POLL TAX (1989-1991) (10 mins)</strong></p>
        <p>"The Poll Tax - a flat-rate local tax regardless of income - triggered the largest civil disobedience campaign in modern British history. Brighton was crucial to its defeat.</p>
        <p>Brighton's resistance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>30,000 non-payers by 1991 (20% of those liable)</li>
            <li>Anti-Poll Tax Union met weekly at the Unemployed Centre</li>
            <li>Mass rallies at the Level</li>
            <li>Resistance to bailiffs through community phone trees</li>
            <li>Legal support and court solidarity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>March 1990: 3,000 marched through Brighton. When London exploded in the Poll Tax Riots, Brighton activists were there.</p>
        <p>Success factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity across class lines</li>
            <li>Combination of non-payment (against) and mutual support (beyond)</li>
            <li>Clear demand: abolition not reform</li>
            <li>Practical solidarity: accompanying people to court</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tax was abolished in 1991. Thatcher resigned. Proof that collective refusal works."</p>

    <h5>Part 3: Patterns and Methods (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"What patterns do we see across these struggles?</p>
        <p><strong>Successful tactics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct action combined with mutual aid</li>
            <li>Clear demands linked to systemic critique</li>
            <li>Practical solidarity not just symbolic support</li>
            <li>Creating alternative institutions while fighting existing ones</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to research radical history:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oral history: Interview participants while they're alive</li>
            <li>Alternative archives: Union records, radical newspapers, personal collections</li>
            <li>Read against the grain: What do hostile sources reveal?</li>
            <li>Place-based investigation: What happened on your street?</li>
            <li>Question absences: Whose stories are missing?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your research matters. Official history won't preserve these stories - we must."</p>

        <p>Optional task: Identify one mutual aid project, self-organized space, or community infrastructure in Brighton. We'll build a resource map together."</p>
