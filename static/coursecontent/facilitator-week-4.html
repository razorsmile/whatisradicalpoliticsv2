    <h4>HOUR 1: Structured Content (60 mins)</h4>

    <h5>Opening (10 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Our final session shifts from past to present. Where does working-class power exist in Brighton right now? Not in parties or campaigns, but in the self-organized infrastructure of survival and resistance.</p>
        <p>This week we draw on Italian Marxist sociology - specifically 'inchiesta operaia' (workers' inquiry) and 'conricerca' (co-research). These methods map power from below.</p>
        <p>Who brought examples of mutual aid or community infrastructure to share?"</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Part 1: Workers' Inquiry and Co-Research (15 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"In 1960s Italy, radical sociologists developed new methods for understanding working-class power. They rejected studying workers as objects, instead practicing co-research - workers and intellectuals investigating together.</p>
        <p><strong>Workers' Inquiry asks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do workers resist exploitation daily?</li>
            <li>What informal organization exists?</li>
            <li>Where is potential power located?</li>
            <li>How does struggle circulate and spread?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Co-Research (Conricerca) means:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research WITH not ON people</li>
            <li>Combining investigation and organization</li>
            <li>Knowledge production as political intervention</li>
            <li>Breaking down researcher/subject divide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Romano Alquati's study of FIAT factories revealed invisible workers' networks - informal communication systems, sabotage practices, and solidarity structures that union officials didn't even know existed.</p>
        <p>We'll apply this to Brighton - but expanding 'workers' to include all sites of working-class life: workplaces, neighborhoods, communities of struggle."</p>

    <h5>Part 2: Categories of Counter-Power (20 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Let's map four types of counter-power in Brighton:</p>
        <p><strong>1. MUTUAL AID NETWORKS</strong><br>
        Direct, horizontal support systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegan Food Bank</li>
            <li>Brighton Solidarity Federation</li>
            <li>Community fridges and food banks</li>
            <li>Informal childcare networks</li>
            <li>Mental health peer support groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These meet immediate needs while building solidarity.</p>
        <p><strong>2. SELF-ORGANIZED SPACES</strong><br>
        Physical infrastructure controlled by communities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Cowley Club (social center)</li>
            <li>BMECP Centre (Black and minority ethnic community)</li>
            <li>The Bevy (community-owned pub)</li>
            <li>Community gardens and allotments</li>
            <li>Squatted social centers (when active)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Space is power - who controls it matters.</p>
        <p><strong>3. ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIES</strong><br>
        Non-capitalist forms of exchange:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brighton LETS (local exchange trading)</li>
            <li>Credit unions</li>
            <li>Worker cooperatives (Infinity Foods, etc.)</li>
            <li>Time banks</li>
            <li>Skill shares and free shops</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These demonstrate other ways of organizing production and distribution.</p>
        <p><strong>4. KNOWLEDGE COMMONS</strong><br>
        Collective learning and information sharing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Radical lending libraries</li>
            <li>Know Your Rights trainings</li>
            <li>Community research projects</li>
            <li>Alternative media (Brighton Voice legacy)</li>
            <li>Informal education networks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Knowledge is power when collectively held.</p>
        <p>None of these alone threatens capitalism - but together they form what Antonio Negri called 'the multitude' - dispersed but connected sites of resistance and creation."</p>

    <h5>Part 3: Mapping Exercise Introduction (15 mins)</h5>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script:</strong></p>
        <p>"Now we'll create our own map of counter-power. This isn't academic exercise - it's practical resource building.</p>
        <p>[Distribute worksheet]</p>
        <p><strong>Your Research Task:</strong><br>
        Think of ONE site of counter-power you know about. Answer:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is it? (name, location, function)</li>
            <li>Who participates? (demographics, numbers)</li>
            <li>How does it operate? (structure, decision-making)</li>
            <li>What needs does it meet?</li>
            <li>What potential does it have?</li>
            <li>How could it connect to other sites?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This could be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your workplace (informal organization, not official unions)</li>
            <li>Your neighborhood (WhatsApp groups, support networks)</li>
            <li>Communities you're part of (identity-based, interest-based)</li>
            <li>Projects you know about</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're looking for ACTUAL organization, not theoretical potential."</p>

            <li>Where are the concentrations of counter-power?</li>
            <li>What connections could be strengthened?</li>
            <li>What's missing?</li>
            <li>How could this resource be used strategically?"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>[10 mins discussion]</p>
        <p>[5 mins report back]</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Final Discussion: From Mapping to Movement (10 mins)</h5>
    <p><strong>Discussion Prompts:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>"How does this map change how you see Brighton?"</li>
        <li>"What would it mean to connect these sites of counter-power?"</li>
        <li>"How does this relate to Your Party's electoral strategy?"</li>
        <li>"What's our next step with this knowledge?"</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="facilitator-script">
        <p><strong>Facilitator Script for Closing:</strong></p>
        <p>"We've spent four weeks developing analytical tools - philosophical, political, historical, and sociological. You've seen that radical politics isn't one thing but many traditions in conversation. You've explored different relationships to state power. You've learned Brighton's hidden history of resistance. And tonight, you've mapped actually existing counter-power.</p>
        <p>These aren't abstract ideas but practical tools. The question isn't whether radical change is possible - our history and present mapping show it is. The question is how we organize to make it happen.</p>
        <p>This map we've created - it's yours. Take photos, share it, use it. Add to it. This is co-research in practice.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your commitment to these four weeks. The course ends but the work continues. As the old Industrial Workers of the World saying goes: 'We are building the new world in the shell of the old.'"</p>
